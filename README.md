# Updated Repository Description

# Learning Journey Repository

This repository holds sentimental value as it represents my initial steps into the world of coding during my early university days. It contains one of my first codes, crafted without prior experience. The purpose of maintaining this repository is to serve as a reminder of the journey from a novice to a learner, emphasizing the belief that continuous learning and exploration are key to mastering the art of programming and writing code. Each revisit to this repository reflects progress, growth, and the endless possibilities in the realm of software development. ðŸŒ±ðŸ’»âœ¨
